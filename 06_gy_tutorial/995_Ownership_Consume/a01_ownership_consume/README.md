# Ownership Rules

- First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

  1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
  2. There can only be one owner at a time.
  3.  When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

  1. At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
  2. References must always be valid.
